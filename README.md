1. Code Structure
The code is organized using a modular and object-oriented approach through the MobiusStrip class. This structure enhances reusability and clarity:

__init__: Accepts user-defined parameters — radius R, width w, and resolution n. It also sets up a meshgrid for parameters u and v.

compute_coordinates(): Implements the Möbius strip parametric equations to generate 3D coordinates (x, y, z).

compute_surface_area(): Numerically estimates the surface area using gradients and integration.

compute_edge_length(): Calculates the total length of the boundary edges.

plot(): Uses Matplotlib to generate a 3D visualization of the strip.


2. Surface Area Approximation
To estimate the surface area, we:

Calculated partial derivatives of the mesh coordinates (x, y, z) with respect to u and v using np.gradient.

Computed the magnitude of the cross product between these partial derivatives, which gives the infinitesimal surface area elements.

Applied Simpson’s Rule (via scipy.integrate.simpson) twice — first along v, then along u — to integrate over the entire surface.

This approach numerically approximates the surface area over a discretized parametric surface.


3. Challenges Faced
Deprecation Warning: The older simps function from SciPy has been deprecated. Replacing it with simpson resolved the import issue.

Mesh Handling: Ensuring correct array shapes and axes for differentiation and integration was tricky.

Numerical Stability: Choosing the right resolution n is a trade-off — too low loses detail; too high slows computation or introduces noise.
